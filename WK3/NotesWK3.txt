public string Number {get} doesnt change
Whats the relationship between field and propertry?
in .NET:
	there are mutplie languages
		C#, F#, VB.NET
(C++/CLI)
	Multiple Runtimes:
	Window, MAC, Linx, 32-bit, 64-bit
	but also mobile, embedded systems/IoT

	different runtime with different priorities(.NET6, mono)

	Multiple Frameworks



.NET Framework
standardizes as: Common Language Infrastructure (CLI)
SOURCE CODE --> COMPILER-->ASSEMBLY-->RUNTIME:
					Virtual Excecution System(VES)
					Just-in-time complier (JIT)
					Executes that native code
					Implement memory managment(garbage collection)


different .NET implementations:
-.NET Framework(VES=Common Language Runtime(CLR)) [windows only]
-Mono was reversed engineer to run on linux [linux/mac only]
-.NET Core v1-3.1
-.NET	   v5-6  next version of .NET Core, rebranded

the common denominator of .NET Framework and .NET Core is called .NET Standard.
