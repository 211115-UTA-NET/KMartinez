	**EXCEPTIONS**
Keywords: try, catch, finally, throw.
Exceptions in C# provide a structured, uniform, and type-safe way of handling both system level and application level error conditions. The exception mechanism in C# is quite similar to that of C++, with a few important differences:

In C#, all exceptions must be represented by an instance of a class type derived from System.Exception. 
In C++, any value of any type can be used to represent an exception.
In C#, a finally block (The try statement) can be used to write termination code that executes in both normal execution and exceptional conditions. Such code is difficult to write in C++ without duplicating code.
In C#, system-level exceptions such as overflow, divide-by-zero, and null dereferences have well defined exception classes and are on a par with application-level error conditions.

An exception is similar to an if else, because they are working through conditionals.

$-is an injections. Drops values without needing to use the concatenation of a string.
${<display>}:<string> literal{<display>}

	**NAMESPACE**
keyword: namespace <EnterNamespaceName>
Namespaces are used to organize the classes. It helps to control the scope of methods and classes in larger . Net programming projects. ... The biggest advantage of using namespace is that the class names which are declared in one namespace will not clash with the same class names declared in another namespace.

	**PARAMETERS**
• Value - Creates a copy of the parameter passed son
modification does not affect each other.
Reference-reftkeyword) causes a method to refer
to the same variable that was passed into the
method. Making changes to original.
*Out-out (Keyword) -used when you want to return
more than one value.
•Array - Darms Ckeyword)- must be 1. Dimensional arraya Allows
us to send a varible number of parametrs to
a function
• Interface - interface (keyword) used to enforced the
presence of a method in any class that implements
it

What is Abstraction?
a way to cut out all the data and simplify code. Like Facebook or Instagram. You take a picture or write out some text and press post. Abstract is the behind the sence of what it takes to post the user's content.


What is Polymorphism in C#?
Polymorphism, in C#, is the ability of objects of different types to provide a unique interface for different implementations of methods. ... Polymorphism forms one of the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming, along with encapsulation and inheritance. Polymorphism provides the ability to a class to have multiple implementations with the same name. has one name with multiple functionalities.


What is an Inheritance?
In C#, inheritance is a process in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of its parent object automatically. In such way, you can reuse, extend or modify the attributes and behaviors which is defined in other class. Include I in the inheritance class to know its Inherit.

In C#, the class which inherits the members of another class is called derived class and the class whose members are inherited is called base class. The derived class is the specialized class for the base class.
The code can be reusable, less code will be required since it can reuse members of the parent class.


What is Encapsulation?
A way to protect data.
What is SHH?
SSH or Secure Shell is a network communication protocol that enables two computers to communicate (c.f http or hypertext transfer protocol, which is the protocol used to transfer hypertext such as web pages) and share data.

Difference between Primitive Types and Reference Types.
Primitive hold the value of the primitive type directly. 
Reference hold refernce pointer to objects which reside in the garbage collection heap.


Whats a list?
Like an array but not fixed. keywork is List <T>

What is an array?
In C#, array is an object of base type System.Array. In C#, array index starts from 0. We can store only fixed set of elements in C# array. Array can be string or integer but not mixed. To create a single dimensional array, you need to use [] after the type. Example int[] arr = new int[5]; To declare and initialize do int[] arr = new int [5]{10,20,40} or int[] arr = new int []{10,20,40} or int[] arr = {10,20,40}
